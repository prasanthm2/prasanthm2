Project Description
Modern metadata management systems require automated data lineage extraction to understand how data flows between tables, views, and stored procedures. Column-level lineage tracking helps in data governance, impact analysis, and regulatory compliance. However, traditional rule-based SQL parsing methods are complex, rigid, and do not generalize well across different database platforms.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered lineage extraction model that can infer column-level dependencies from SQL queries and metadata, working offline without APIs. The system will utilize open-source transformer models such as T5-Small, CodeLlama, or MiniLM to predict source-to-target column relationships. By training the model on SQL query patterns, the intern will develop a lineage extraction tool that works independently of third-party APIs.

The project will involve:

Training a deep learning model to extract column-level lineage from SQL queries.
Building an offline AI pipeline to analyze metadata without relying on rule-based parsing.
Developing a structured output for lineage mappings and storing results in a metadata repository.
Validating lineage accuracy using real-world SQL queries.
Integrating lineage extraction insights into metadata governance frameworks.
This work will enhance metadata traceability, reduce manual effort in lineage extraction, and provide automated SQL-to-lineage mapping for structured and semi-structured databases.

Description of Work to be Delivered by Intern:
Metadata lineage tracking is a crucial challenge in SQL-based systems, where stored procedures, views, and queries involve complex transformations. Traditional methods rely on static SQL parsing, which fails to generalize across different database engines (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, Oracle, etc.).

The intern will work on:

Training a Transformer-Based Model for SQL Lineage

Fine-tune T5-Small or CodeLlama on a dataset of SQL queries and expected lineage mappings.
Generate column-level dependencies by mapping source-to-target transformations.
Building an Offline Lineage Extraction Tool

Develop a standalone Python package that can take SQL queries as input and return column lineage mappings.
Use deep learning rather than traditional SQL parsers for flexibility and accuracy.
Metadata Storage & Query Insights

Store extracted lineage information in a structured format (JSON, SQLite, or Neo4j for visualization).
Provide SQL metadata insights, such as frequently joined tables, redundant columns, and transformation patterns.
Validating Model Performance

Compare AI-generated lineage against known metadata mappings.
Use precision, recall, and accuracy metrics to evaluate the lineage extraction model.
This project will demonstrate how AI can replace rule-based SQL parsing and automate metadata lineage extraction. The internâ€™s work will enhance metadata intelligence, making it easier to track data transformations across multiple SQL-based environments.
This project will allow the intern to gain hands-on experience in UI/UX development, data structuring, and visualization, while making a significant impact on improving the visibility of the Platform Teamâ€™s work. ðŸš€
