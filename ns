1. Details of What We Get from MS Map, How, and Where It Is Used

    We use data from MS Map in a unique way: rather than treating it as standalone metadata, we integrate it into our data catalog application.
    For instance, LDAP group details from MS Map are crucial in linking datasets to the appropriate departments.
    We also utilize the person graph to establish connections between datasets and their creators, giving context to data ownership.
    This integration significantly enriches our metadata catalog, ensuring it is well-connected and insightful for organizational use.

    From DB2 and Hadoop: Our technical metadata collection is quite comprehensive, covering tables, views, columns, and more. We gather this information using system queries and APIs, and it’s processed through structured procedures.
    Through CTS Ops: We gather operational metadata, which helps us monitor job schedules, policy details, and ETL performance. This data is essential for keeping our ETL processes efficient and reliable.
    Using ETL Tools: Lineage metadata comes from tools like Informatica and CDL. We create this by parsing XML configurations and custom scripts, giving us a clear view of data flow and dependencies.
    Via TAI Systems: Additional metadata, like LDAP and ProID information, supports our access control and governance strategies.

3. Blurb on the Various Inferences We Do When We Process Data

    We link data entities by connecting job schedules from CTS Ops to tables, which clarifies how ETL workflows impact data assets.
    ETL configurations from tools like Informatica are analyzed to map data from its source to the target.
    Dependency rules, such as those based on naming conventions and retention policies, ensure our data remains consistent and reliable.
    We’ve also automated many processes to make metadata parsing and lineage creation efficient, providing a transparent view of data movement and ensuring operational compliance.


1. Details of What We Get from MS Map, How, and Where It Is Used

    Purpose: We don’t use MS Map data as standalone metadata but rather to enhance our data catalog with relevant connections.
    Usage Examples:
        LDAP Group Details: Used to link datasets to the respective departments that utilize them.
        Person Graph: Connects datasets to the creators, providing insight into data ownership and creation.
    Integration Benefit: This approach enriches our metadata catalog, making it more useful for organizational context and user associations.

    DB2 and Hadoop:
        Technical Metadata: Collected via system queries (DB2) and APIs (Hadoop), including tables, views, columns, indexes, and space usage.
        Processing: Data is processed through stored procedures to ensure accuracy and relevance.
    CTS Ops:
        Operational Metadata: Includes job schedules, purge policies, and ETL logs to monitor system performance.
        Usage: Helps in tracking and optimizing ETL processes.
    ETL Tools (Informatica, CDL, Custom Scripts):
        Lineage Metadata: Created by parsing ETL configurations, XML files, and scripts to understand data flow.
        Purpose: Enables end-to-end data traceability.
    TAI Systems:
        Additional Metadata: Collects details like LDAP groups and ProIDs for managing access control.
        Governance: Supports data access and security measures.

    Entity Linking: Connects job schedules from CTS Ops to tables, linking ETL workflows to data assets.
    ETL Parsing: Analyzes configurations from Informatica and CDL to determine source-to-target mappings.
    Data Dependency Rules: Uses job frequency, naming conventions, and retention policies to ensure data integrity.
    Automated Processes: Employs scripts to parse ETL code, making lineage creation efficient and comprehensive.
    Traceability: Provides a full view of data movement, helping maintain compliance and operational transparency.
