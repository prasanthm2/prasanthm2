Slide 1: Introduction

Automated Column Description Generation

Our team is integrating a prototype developed by another team to automate the generation of column descriptions.

The system leverages LLMs and metadata retrieval to generate business-relevant descriptions for database columns.

This will help streamline our metadata management process and improve documentation consistency.

Slide 2: How It Works

Workflow Overview

Metadata Input â€“ Object metadata (column names, data types, sample values) is provided.

Metadata Retrieval â€“ The system fetches previously generated business concepts and relevant information.

Prompt Construction â€“ The metadata and retrieved data are used to construct a detailed prompt for the LLM.

LLM Processing â€“ The LLM generates business concepts and descriptions based on the prompt.

Storage in Vector Database â€“ The descriptions are stored for future reference and semantic search.

Integration & Analysis â€“ The generated descriptions are reviewed and refined as needed.

Slide 3: Integration with Metadata Repository

How We Use It

The automatically generated descriptions will be stored in our Metadata Repository.

This ensures that each column has a clear, accurate, and standardized description.

The system will allow quick updates and retrieval of descriptions for newly added columns.

Semantic search capabilities will help enhance discoverability and lineage tracking.

Slide 4: Benefits

Key Advantages of Automated Description Generation

âœ” Saves Time â€“ Eliminates the manual effort of writing descriptions.
âœ” Ensures Consistency â€“ Uniform terminology across all metadata assets.
âœ” Improves Accuracy â€“ LLM ensures high relevance to business concepts.
âœ” Enhances Searchability â€“ Metadata descriptions can be semantically searched.
âœ” Supports Scalability â€“ Easily adapts to growing datasets and schema changes.

Slide 5: Next Steps

Implementation Plan

âœ… Pilot Testing â€“ Run a test on a subset of metadata to validate accuracy.

ðŸ”„ Feedback & Refinement â€“ Collect feedback from SMEs and improve prompts.

ðŸš€ Full Integration â€“ Automate the description generation process in the metadata repository.

ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Optimization â€“ Continuously assess system performance and refine where needed.

Slide 6: Conclusion

The Future of Metadata Management

By leveraging AI-powered description generation, we streamline metadata documentation.

This initiative aligns with our goal of improving metadata governance.

Continuous improvement and feedback loops will ensure high-quality metadata insights.
