Problem Statement:
Metadata Suggestion Engine for Enhanced Data Management and Governance

With the NFRT's Data team managing a centralized metadata repository for all departments, there is an increasing need to leverage this metadata to provide intelligent suggestions for improving data management, governance, and operational efficiency. The current system collects metadata but lacks a mechanism to analyze this data and provide actionable recommendations.


Solution:
Metadata Suggestion Engine

We propose developing a suggestion engine that analyzes collected metadata and provides actionable recommendations for optimizing data management processes, improving data quality, and ensuring compliance with governance policies.

Key Features:

Data Quality Improvement Suggestions: Recommend validation rules and cleansing actions based on metadata patterns and anomalies.
Schema Optimization Recommendations: Suggest indexing and schema changes based on query patterns and access frequency.
Usage and Performance Insights: Provide insights into data usage trends and recommend caching, partitioning, archiving, or purging strategies.
Governance and Compliance Recommendations: Automatically classify data and suggest security measures and retention policies based on metadata attributes.
This solution will empower the NFRT Data team by providing actionable insights and recommendations, leveraging existing metadata to drive intelligent decision-making and improve data management practices.



Project Submission: Metadata Bridge
Problem Statement:

Metadata Bridge for Comprehensive Metadata Management

NFRT's Data team requires a flexible and comprehensive solution for managing metadata from various sources and formats. There is a need for a unified Metadata Bridge that can handle onboarding new systems, integrating metadata from APIs, processing uploaded files, and automating metadata extraction and loading.

Solution:

Metadata Bridge

We propose developing a Metadata Bridge that serves as a unified interface for managing metadata operations. This bridge will support multiple sources and formats, providing a seamless and efficient way to handle metadata.

Key Features:

Unified Onboarding Process: A web-based interface for configuring and onboarding new metadata sources, supporting database connections and API endpoints.
Flexible Data Integration: Endpoints for metadata extraction from various tools using APIs, file uploads in formats like CSV, JSON, XML, and monitoring specific locations for metadata files.
Automated Job Scheduling: A job scheduling system to automate metadata extraction at specified intervals, supporting cron-like scheduling.
Secure Access and Authorization: Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints and web interface, with role-based access control (RBAC).
Monitoring and Alerts: Features to track the status of metadata operations with alerts and notifications for job completions, failures, or anomalies.
Extensibility and Scalability: Designed to be extensible and scalable to handle multiple concurrent metadata extraction jobs and new metadata types and sources.
This solution will provide a flexible, user-friendly, and automated system for managing metadata operations, enhancing operational efficiency and ease of use for NFRT Data team members.
