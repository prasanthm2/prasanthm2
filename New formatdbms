NFRT Metadata Platform - Full Expo Speaker Notes
------------------------------------------------

Slide 1: Problem Statement
--------------------------
Today’s organizations deal with highly complex and distributed data environments.
Without strong metadata management, finding the right data, understanding its quality,
and trusting its usage becomes very difficult.

We face challenges like:
- Difficulty discovering the right data assets.
- Poor visibility into how data moves across systems.
- Lack of clear ownership and accountability for data.
- Creation of duplicate datasets due to lack of trusted discovery.
- Time-consuming impact analysis during changes.
- Gaps in governance, audit readiness, and prevention of duplicate datasets.

These issues delay decision-making, increase risks, and lead to inefficiencies.
The NFRT Metadata Platform addresses these challenges by making metadata live, connected, and actionable.

Slide 2: Outcomes
-----------------
The NFRT Metadata Platform delivers outcomes across business, technology, and governance:

- Improved Traceability: End-to-end data flow and transformation visibility.
- Clear Ownership: Accountability and stewardship for all data assets.
- Faster Impact Analysis: Quickly assess downstream effects of upstream changes.
- Proactive Alerts: Early notifications for key data issues.
- Metadata-Driven Decisions: Confident, faster decision-making based on trusted insights.
- Continuous Data Quality Monitoring: Tracking freshness, completeness, and usage patterns.
- Improved Data Discovery: Searchable, trusted datasets with meaningful context.
- Compliance and Audit Readiness: Metadata history supports governance needs.

Slide 3: Methodology and Solution
---------------------------------
The platform operates on four key principles:

- Always On: Continuously collects metadata from databases, ETL pipelines, reporting systems, and repositories.
- Intelligent: Builds lineage graphs, detects anomalies, and recommends actions.
- Action-Oriented: Enables alerts, workflows, and real-time insights.
- Open and Flexible: Connects via direct system access, APIs, and code-based integration.

It delivers capabilities such as:
- Traceability of data flows.
- Visibility into data transformations and usage.
- Ownership mapping and collaboration.
- Impact analysis and operational awareness.
- Unified metadata across business, technical, and operational layers.

Slide 4: Final Summary
----------------------
The NFRT Metadata Platform is built to transform metadata from passive documentation into a living,
intelligent foundation for managing data across NFRT projects.

By continuously collecting business, technical, and operational metadata, it enables:

- Faster discovery of trusted datasets.
- Clear visibility into ownership and transformations.
- Better collaboration between business and technical teams.
- Improved governance, audit readiness, and operational awareness.

While firmwide cataloging is handled by FDC using Collibra, our platform complements it by going deeper
into NFRT-specific metadata and enabling use cases beyond cataloging — including lineage, impact analysis,
and platform-level insights.

In short, NFRT Metadata Platform turns metadata into a strategic asset — improving trust, agility,
and data-driven decision-making.
