1. Performance and Impact
Examples or context:
Prateek joined us for a short two-month internship as part of his final-year college program, and during this period, he made a strong impact with his work. He was assigned to the PlatformView project, which involves UI development to visualize various metadata and ETL-related statistics. Even though it was his first time working on this kind of project, he was quick to understand the requirements and start contributing. He managed to complete the full set of assigned tasks within the timeline, with minimal follow-ups needed. He asked relevant questions early on and then worked independently. His ability to grasp the context quickly and deliver his part with full ownership was impressive, especially for someone who had only two months with the team.

2. Risk and Controls
Examples or context:
Despite being here for a short time, Prateek showed good awareness when it came to following team coding standards and development practices. He was careful not to make assumptions and always clarified doubts to ensure he was building things the right way. He followed version control protocols properly, tested his changes before raising them for review, and responded well to feedback from the reviewers. His code was structured neatly and aligned with the quality we expect in the team. He didn’t rush through tasks and showed seriousness in delivering his part responsibly, which reduced any risk of rework or issues later. That discipline in such a short time shows maturity.

3. Culture and Values
Examples or context:
Prateek quickly became part of the team even though he had limited time with us. He was polite, respectful, and open to feedback from day one. He participated in team discussions and never hesitated to ask questions or help others when needed. He maintained a positive and professional attitude throughout the internship. Even in team calls or discussions, he was attentive and made sure he was aligned with the team’s progress. He gelled well with teammates and showed that he’s not just technically sound but also a good fit for team culture. For someone doing a two-month internship, the comfort level and professionalism he brought in was really good.

4. Professional Development
Advice or feedback:
Prateek is at the beginning of his professional journey, and in these two months, he has shown good learning attitude and ownership. My suggestion for him going forward is to continue exploring more technical areas, especially backend systems or database work, to build a full-stack understanding. He has strong basics and the right mindset, so if he continues with this curiosity and consistency, he will surely grow into a dependable and skilled developer. After completing college, he should try to get involved in more design discussions and larger problem-solving scenarios to further sharpen his skills. We would be happy to see him come back and grow further with the team.
