🏗️ Design & Implementation Plan for CaSC Upload (Intermediary Approach)
✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Pilot with Non-Sensitive System)
1. System Selection
Choose a system with:

No PII/SDE

Simple data structures

Stable metadata already present in your metadata platform
Example: Internal reporting system, static lookup data source

2. Manifest Generation Logic
Build a script (Python preferred) to:

Read metadata from your platform

Generate CaSC-compliant YAML/JSON manifest

Validate against FDC format specs

Drop to predefined /intermediary/NFS/location

3. Folder Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
/intermediary/NFS/location/
  └── system_name/
        └── manifest_YYYYMMDD.yaml
4. Validation & Coordination with FDC Team
Share the manifest with FDC for review.

Get it whitelisted for polling.

Trigger a dry run (check ingestion by FDC CaSC Tool).

🚀 Phase 2: Expand to More Systems (Still Good Citizen)
1. Automation
Automate manifest generation for 2–3 more systems.

Schedule jobs (hourly/daily) for refreshing and uploading manifests.

2. Monitoring & Logging
Log upload status

Monitor NFS path usage and FDC polling success/failure

3. Document Learnings
Maintain a checklist per system:

Attributes present

Gaps

Transformations applied

Upload result

🔒 Phase 3: Governance-Ready Metadata
1. Assess Governance Gaps
Start identifying:

Missing SDE

PII tagging needs

Business glossary or classifications

2. Update Metadata Models
Enrich your metadata store to include required governance fields.

Create mapping/lookup tables for department, stewardship, ownership, etc.

3. Phase-wise Rollout
For each system, tag the governance level:

🚦Level 0: Basic Metadata (Good Citizen)

🚦Level 1: SDE/PII present

🚦Level 2: Fully governed (linked to policy, lineage, glossary)

🛠️ Technical Artifacts Needed
Component	Description
manifest_generator.py	Script to create CaSC manifest from your metadata model
config.yaml	Metadata mapping config (source field → CaSC field)
upload_job.sh	Shell or scheduler job to copy manifest to NFS
log_uploads.log	Logging file for manifest generation and upload result
manifest_sample.yaml	Sample FDC-approved manifest for reference

📌 Governance Alignment Tracker (Sample Template)
System	SDE Present	PII Present	Cataloged	Notes
System A	❌	❌	✅	First pilot
System B	✅	❌	❌	Next phase
System C	✅	✅	❌	Final rollout
