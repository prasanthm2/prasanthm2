Prateek is just getting started in his career, but the way he approached this internship shows that he has good potential.

Explanation for your current decision:
Prateek did a good job in this short internship. Since he is in his final year, he will now go back and complete his studies. But based on how he worked here, I feel he will be a strong candidate to rejoin after college. He has shown good learning ability, ownership, and a positive mindset.


Prateek has shown good promise during his short internship with us. His timely delivery, commitment to learning, and team-friendly nature make him a dependable contributor. If given more time, he will be able to take on more responsibilities confidently. I would support his extension or conversion based on project needs and available opportunities.
