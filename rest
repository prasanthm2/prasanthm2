Data Onboarding Initiative: Departmental Request

Initiation of Data Request: The respective departmental units will initiate a formal data requisition through inter-departmental communication channels. This protocol assists in projecting the workload for upcoming development sprints.
Request Submission Protocol: The data requisition will be communicated via electronic mail or through the designated communication portal.
Prospective UI Integration: Future enhancements may include the development of a web-based user interface, leveraging the centralized metadata repository to streamline the onboarding requisition process.
Onboarding Documentation: Business Compliance and Technical Specifications

Business Requirement Documentation: Departments are required to complete onboarding documentation, detailing all pertinent business-level information for approval. This includes:
A comprehensive business rationale for the data feed, inclusive of concept definitions at the resource level.
Critical source system details, such as Global Resource Number (GRN) and other relevant identifiers.
Additional specifications encompassing:
Frequency and scheduling of data loads (days and times specified).
Data load methodology (incremental vs. full load considerations).
Historical data requirements (Yes/No) and the extent of historical data needed.
Data retention policies for the target system.
Technical Mapping Documentation: Data Integration and Governance

Technical Mapping Requisites: The technology team is tasked with the completion of technical mapping documents essential for the integration of the onboarding data.
Mapping Document Details: This document shall encapsulate:
Locations of source databases/files/APIs/tables/views and their corresponding attributes.
A thorough description of each data element, including personally identifiable information (PII) considerations.
Utility of Mapping Documentation: These documents serve as a foundation for the subsequent development and cataloging phases, ensuring data governance and integrity.

Data Development and Cataloging

Onboarding Documentation Completion: After onboarding forms are finalized, details are logged in the Jira board for sprint planning.
Process Development: Developers utilize the mapping document to construct the data process.
Quality Assurance and Migration: Post-unit testing, developers are tasked with cataloging all pertinent details into the metadata inventory UI ahead of migration to production environments.
Metadata Inventory: Technical metadata for the platform is auto-extracted; manual input is required for additional specifics.
Metadata Includes:
Source Platform Identifiers (e.g., GRN, EONID)
API, file, table, and view details
Target system data elements, process jobs, and integration steps
Comprehensive listings from staging to final data structures



Data Team Onboarding and Cataloging Enhancements

Cataloging Interface Development: An advanced WebUI will be developed on the Sysdict portal, integrating with the metadata inventory database to streamline cataloging activities.
Metadata Inventory Integration: The existing metadata inventory already encompasses comprehensive technical details of onboarded platforms. The new WebUI will augment this by incorporating additional information, automating data derivation wherever possible.
Key Information Components:

Databases: Details about databases and their properties.
Resources: Information about tables, views, and attributes.
Permissions: Access controls and grants at the resource level.
Indexing: Index attributes and statistics for resources.
Storage Metrics: Space usage and row count analytics.
Data Retention: Policy details at the table level for data purging.
Data Lineage Tools: Information flow tracing from Informatica and Talend at the resource and data element levels, and CDL integration specifics.
Job Scheduling: Existing Autosys job details with the necessity to extract Airflow job configurations.
LDAP & Proid Management: LDAP group configurations and member details, along with Proid specifications.
