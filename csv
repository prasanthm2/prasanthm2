✅ Main Requirements for Metadata Platform (3–4 Months)
Crawlers

Existing Talend jobs for DB2 and SQL Server

Need to add for PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Neo4j, etc.

Swagger UI

Expose metadata APIs

Full Swagger UI development for consumers

Gen AI Implementation

Auto-generate descriptions and labels

Use vector store for semantic search

Derive lineage from XMLs

Generate summaries

Create a platform to handle multiple Gen AI use cases (as backend services)

Data Quality Integration

Integrate with multiple data quality tools

👨‍💻 Developer-Wise Work Summary
🔹 Full Stack Developer
Develop REST APIs for metadata (tables, columns, jobs, glossary, lineage)

Set up and complete Swagger UI for all APIs

Build/enhance UI (React/Angular):

Global search and filter

Metadata detail pages

Lineage visualization (graph/tree)

Display existing metadata fields and API responses

Add authentication and security for API access

🔹 Data Engineer
Build new Talend or script-based crawlers for:

PostgreSQL

Snowflake

Neo4j

Apply standard metadata structure and implement SCD2 logic

Ensure run metadata and job info are captured

Integrate with one or more data quality tools (e.g., Great Expectations)

Build ingestion logic for DQ metrics (null %, duplicates, rule violations)

🔹 Gen AI Expert
Build Gen AI solution for auto-generating descriptions and labels

Parse ETL XMLs to derive column-level lineage

Generate summaries for jobs or platforms

Set up and manage a vector store (e.g., FAISS or Chroma)

Expose all Gen AI functionalities as backend services (no UI integration)

Ensure outputs are stored in metadata tables or served via APIs for other services to consume
