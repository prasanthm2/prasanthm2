NFRT Metadata Platform - Problem Statement
------------------------------------------

In today's distributed data landscape, organizations often struggle with poor visibility into their data ecosystems.
Without strong metadata management, key challenges emerge that impact trust, governance, and operational efficiency.

The problems we aim to solve include:

- Difficulty discovering the right data assets across systems.
- Poor visibility into how data moves and transforms across layers.
- Lack of clear ownership and accountability for datasets and processes.
- Creation of duplicate datasets due to lack of trusted discovery.
- Time-consuming and manual impact analysis during change management.
- Gaps in governance, audit readiness, and prevention of duplicate datasets.

These challenges lead to operational inefficiencies, delayed decision-making, compliance risks, and poor user trust in data.
The NFRT Metadata Platform is designed to address these issues by making metadata live, connected, and actionable

NFRT Metadata Platform - Final Summary
--------------------------------------

The NFRT Metadata Platform is built to transform metadata from passive documentation into a living, intelligent foundation
for managing data across NFRT projects.

By continuously collecting business, technical, and operational metadata, it enables:

- Faster discovery of trusted datasets.
- Clear visibility into ownership and transformations.
- Better collaboration between business and technical teams.
- Improved governance, audit readiness, and operational awareness.

While firmwide cataloging is handled by FDC using Collibra, our platform complements it by going deeper into NFRT-specific metadata
and enabling use cases beyond cataloging â€” including lineage, impact analysis, and platform-level insights.

In short, NFRT Metadata Platform turns metadata into a strategic asset â€” improving trust, agility, and data-driven decision-making.
