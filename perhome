Performance and Impact:
I have been managing the System Dictionary project on my own from the beginning. Over time, I have made many improvements to the application and increased its efficiency. This has made it useful to many teams, especially the data team and the LCD teams, who now use it to get insights.

I’ve worked on adding metadata from different sources, making it even more helpful. For example, I worked on integrating with O2 Query Manager, Informatica, and the Caspian Data Loader tool to improve data lineage. I also created dashboards for the System Dictionary, which help the Caspian team a lot by showing data about space usage, daily and weekly growth, and more. These dashboards are important to the NFRT data team.

Even though some team members left, I managed to keep the project on track without any issues. I’ve also supported other teams, like RDBMS, GraphDB, and MetaFactory, while keeping things running smoothly. I work closely with business teams to gather requirements and turn them into code. I also take part in discussions with different teams and help by offering suggestions and solutions. I always assist juniors and other team members when needed.

Risk and Control:
I have kept our work in line with company policies and made sure everything is running smoothly. I have also managed timelines for various tasks like integrations and dashboards, preventing risks and keeping the System Dictionary project stable. I regularly work with teams to identify any risks and take action to solve them.

Culture and Values:
I have helped create a positive, team-focused environment where everyone gets the support they need. I’ve also been active in mentoring and helping others grow their skills while making sure we meet project deadlines.

Manager Effectiveness:
In managing the project, I have worked with several team members throughout the year. I’ve made sure to get good results while also helping them improve their skills. I’ve kept technical processes smooth and made sure everyone finishes their work on time, keeping everything on track and productive.

Professional Development:
This year, I’ve focused on learning new skills, moving from RDBMS to GraphDB based on project needs. I’ve also worked on the UI development for MetaFactory, which has helped me grow my technical abilities. I also completed my Azure Administrator certification a few months ago, which was a personal goal.
