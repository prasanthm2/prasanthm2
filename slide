Implement monthly one-on-one coaching sessions to align individual and organizational objectives.
Initiate a team-led 'Skill Share' series to promote continuous learning and cross-training.
Streamline the onboarding process to reinforce team values and achieve positive newcomer feedback.

Regularly recognize and celebrate team achievements and individual contributions that exemplify the firm's values, aiming for at least one recognition per month.
Host a quarterly workshop or team-building activity focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion to cultivate a more understanding and supportive team environment.
Implement a peer-feedback system that encourages constructive dialogue and mutual respect, with the goal of collecting and acting on feedback from at least 75% of the team by year-end.

Goal 1: Complete Dataset Cataloging

By Q2 2024, finalize the cataloging of all MSSB datasets.
By Q3 2024, complete the cataloging of all E-Trade datasets.
Maintain documentation of cataloging processes and standards.
Goal 2: Establish Compliance Mechanism

By Q1 2024, develop an automated system for cataloging reminders.
Implement a tracking system to monitor compliance rates.
Aim for a 90% cataloging task completion rate across the team by Q4 2024.
Goal 3: Enforce Team Engagement

Initiate monthly cataloging sprints with incentives for early completion.
Set up a leaderboard to highlight top contributors to cataloging efforts.
Conduct quarterly reviews to recognize achievements and reinforce expectations.

Recognize a team member monthly for outstanding contribution to team values.
Organize quarterly diversity and inclusion activities to foster team unity.
Introduce a peer-feedback initiative to encourage open and respectful communication.



Leverage the Event Listener feature provided by Spark to configure the Event Listener to collect the required information, including lineage details.
Configure the Event Listener to collect additional information required for lineage analysis.
Connect to the Event Listener and retrieve the logs containing lineage information.
Utilize log readers such as Fluentbit to extract and transform the data from the logs into a tabular format.
Load the transformed information into the target database for further analysis and usage.

Understand that Talend has a feature to export lineage information in the form of mapping files, which can be in various formats such as XML, HTML, or JSON.
Develop a script or process to parse sample HTML files to extract the source and target mapping information.
Implement a mechanism to load the extracted mapping information from the sample files into the desired tables or repositories.
Validate the automation by demonstrating successful extraction and loading of mapping information from the sample files.
Once the process is proven successful with sample files, communicate the requirement to teams to include their mapping files along with their jar files in Git repositories where code is maintained.
